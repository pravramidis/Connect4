This is an implementation of the connect4 game by Prodromos Avramidis.

To run the game create a home folder and place the java files in the src/ce326/hw3/ folder path and the icons in the icons/ folder path.
Adding the org.json library is also required.

When the window opens the user can start the game by clicking start game.
The user can change the difficulty and the starting player by using the menubar.

After starting the game the user can choose a column to play either by double clicking with the mouse or using the number on the keyboard(0-6).

After starting the game the user can find a history of all previously completed games by clicking the histroy menu item.
If the user clicks the history menu item again he is taken back to the current game.
If the user double clicks a game from the list the current game is stopped and a replay of the chosen game starts playing.

Notes:
Both right clicking and left clicking work as i saw no point in disabling the right click.
